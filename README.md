# MySQL Roadmap

A structured, beginner-friendly roadmap to learn MySQL from fundamentals to real-world queries and interview preparation.

This repository is designed as a **self-study SQL course**, focusing on clarity, hands-on practice, and progressive learning rather than scattered notes.

## Who This Repository Is For

- Beginners with **no prior SQL experience**
- College students learning databases
- Developers who want to **strengthen backend fundamentals**
- Anyone preparing for **internships, placements, or SQL interviews**

1. Start from the `01_basics` folder
2. Read the concept files (`.md`)
3. Practice using the queries in `practice.sql`
4. Use the datasets provided in the `datasets` folder
5. Move sequentially through the folders

This repository is meant to be followed **in order**.
